Register the QR code displayed on the registration QR code screen to Google Authenticator or similar apps.
Enter a valid OTP code and click the `CONFIRM OTP` button to verify the OTP.
Once a valid OTP is confirmed, the modal will automatically disappear and the multi-factor authentication setup is complete.
You will be required to enter an OTP during your next login.
*Please never delete the information registered on your multi-factor authentication device, as this will prevent you from logging in.
