# Host PC Basic Configuration

Participants and speakers can only use xBridge while the host (the xBridge account owner) is running a meeting.
Therefore, it is necessary to keep the meeting active continuously during the session.
Please ensure that PC sleep mode or screensaver functions do not unexpectedly stop the PC and terminate the xBridge meeting.

## 1. Connect Power to PC

Always connect a power cable to your PC to ensure the power doesn't run out during the meeting.

## 2. Audio Input Settings

Select your PC's default microphone as the audio source for interpretation.
Therefore, please select the default audio from your PC settings.
