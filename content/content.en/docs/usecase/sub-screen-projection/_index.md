# Projecting Interpretation Results to a Sub-screen

By projecting interpretation results to a separate screen, you can display translation content more clearly for participants.
This procedure explains how to set up a dedicated sub-screen for interpretation results, separate from the main screen.

## Preparation

You need to prepare 2 PCs:

- **Host PC**: The PC that runs the interpretation
- **Projection PC**: The PC that displays interpretation results on the sub-screen

{{< hint warning >}}
**PC Configuration**  
Both PCs need to be configured with the necessary settings beforehand. Please refer to "[Host PC Basic Configuration](../../other/pc-basic-configuration)" for details.

## 1. Create a Meeting

Create an interpretation meeting on the Host PC.

Please refer to "[Create a Meeting](../../conversation/create-conversation)" for detailed procedures.

After creating the meeting, check the participant links and QR codes from the meeting details page.
Please confirm the "Screen Link & QR" that will be used in the next step.

| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Listener Link & QR | Participants who only listen to interpretation. Links to be distributed to venue users for use on their smartphones.                        |
| Speaker Link & QR  | Presenters who provide audio input. Use when there are separate speakers or when you want to display speaker names different from the host. |
| Screen Link & QR   | Links for staff responsible for screen projection. Used for screen projection.                                                              |

## 2. Start the Meeting

Start the meeting created on the Host PC.

Please refer to "[Start Meeting](../../conversation/start-conversation)" for detailed procedures.

Main steps:

1. Click the "OPEN ROOM" button in the upper right corner of the meeting details screen to start the meeting
2. Wait for the interpretation system to be ready (10-60 seconds)
3. If the host acts as a speaker, click the microphone button to enable it

{{< hint warning >}}
**Interpretation startup may take time**  
After the meeting starts, it may take up to 60 seconds for the interpretation system to be ready. Please wait until displays such as "Conversation is closed" at the top of the screen disappear.
