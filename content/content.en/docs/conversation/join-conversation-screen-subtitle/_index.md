## Display Subtitles

There are 3 methods for displaying subtitles:

1. **Display Interpretation Results in Full Screen**
2. **Display Subtitles in Picture-in-Picture Mode**
3. **Display Subtitles with Streaming Software**

### Display Interpretation Results in Full Screen

You can display interpretation results across the entire screen using your browser's full-screen mode.
This method is ideal when projecting subtitles onto projectors or sub-screens.

1. Enable full-screen mode in your browser on the subtitle display screen

Click full-screen mode to display in full screen.

2. The interpretation results will be displayed across the entire screen

3. To exit full-screen mode, press the same keys again or press the `Esc` key

**Benefits of Full Screen Mode**  
In full-screen mode, browser navigation bars and other UI elements are hidden, displaying only the subtitles, enabling clear projection that is easy for participants to see.

### Display Subtitles in Picture-in-Picture Mode

By selecting `Picture-in-Picture Mode` from the menu, you can display the subtitle window in picture-in-picture mode.
You can overlay it on Microsoft PowerPoint slideshows or any browser.

**Mac PC users need to use the main workspace**  
For Mac PC users, applications that you project together such as Microsoft PowerPoint need to use the main [workspace](https://support.apple.com/ja-jp/guide/mac-help/mh14112/mac).

### Display Subtitles with Streaming Software

You can display subtitles with streaming software such as OBS.
Get the shared link (full-screen mode), open it as a window, and overlay it with other projection screens.
